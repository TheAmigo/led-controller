# Wiring an LED strip to the Pi
This isn't meant to be a complete tutorial, just a quick reference showing an example of how to connect a basic LED strip light.  In the future, I may add support for RGB strips, but I don't use any, so it's not my current focus.

The PCA9685 is only needed if you need dimming control on more than 2 LED strips.
